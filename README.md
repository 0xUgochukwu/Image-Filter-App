# Image-Filter
A console app that can filter BMP images


## Rules
1. This app only supports BMP images
2. To create the app, run `make filter` in the console or run the code for `filter` in the Makefile manually.


## Usage
After making the file here is how to run the app


#### You have four `filter` options:
1. Blur [`-b`]
2. Grayscale [`-g`]
3. Reflect [`-r`]
4. Edges [`-e`]

Run the app like this in the terminal:

`$ ./filter -[filter option] INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp`

#### WHERE;

* `-[filter option]` is one of the filter options available to you eg. `-g`, `-b`, `-r`, `-e`.
*  `INFILE.bmp` is the directory of the input file and `OUTFILE.bmp` is the directory you wish to put your outputfile.
